            <h2>What's our project about?</h2>
            <p class="lead">Students pay huge effort and time for job hunting. They usually look for companies from many sources such as online job portals, newspaper advertisement etc. They apply for their desired job and wait for a call for interview or to join. More or less, the situation is that students are in need of knocking the doors of employers to get a job. It is not the case that employers are knocking students directly to hire them.</p>
            <p>Organizations or companies must need perfect employees for their institutions and to serve the purpose, they also look for good, talented students who are fit for their organization. They publish job advertisements and wait for the applications from students. They have no other means to reach students directly that can be perfectly suitable for their job position. </p>
            <p>An efficient, effective and faster communication between two parties can resolve the difficulties for both parties where both parties are in need to get the support from each other. To make the goal successful we, a group of students of IT from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), are going to develop a project by which companies can reach directly to students. A student may receive a call from his dream place even without applying there. We want to change the current situation of ‘Job Hunting’ into ‘Student Hunting’. Finding a job for a student or finding a student for a job will become a trouble-free task for both concerned parties. </p>
